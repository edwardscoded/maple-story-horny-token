Here’s a refined version of your Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Maple Story — $HORNY Meme Coin on AVAX. The structure remains intact, but I’ve streamlined the language, clarified objectives, removed redundant details, and enhanced professionalism while preserving the playful tone. I’ve also added specificity where needed and ensured alignment with the project’s unique vibe.
